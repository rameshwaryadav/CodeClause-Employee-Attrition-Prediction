# 📊 Predicting Employee Attrition using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company. It uses the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset and follows a standard data science pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

This project is part of the **Data Science Internship** at **CodeClause**.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The main goal is to develop a robust classification model that can accurately identify employees at risk of attrition. This can help organizations proactively address issues and retain valuable talent.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Python:** Core language for the project.
-   **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
-   **Scikit-learn:** For data preprocessing, building the ML pipeline, training the model, and evaluation.
-   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization, including plotting the confusion matrix.
-   **Joblib:** For saving the trained machine learning model.

## 📋 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:rameshwaryadav/CodeClause-Employee-Attrition-Prediction.git
    
    ```

2.  **Download the Dataset**
    -   Download the dataset from **[Kaggle: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)**.
    -   Place the `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` file inside the `data/` directory.

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Execute the Script**
    Run the main Python script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python predict_attrition.py
    ```
    The script will train the model, display the accuracy and classification report, show a confusion matrix plot, and save the trained model in the `models/` directory.
